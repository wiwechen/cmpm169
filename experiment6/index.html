			<h1>Experiment 6 - Grammars & Text Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>
					I wanted to try to use something from the lecture slides, but for some reason, I couldn't get any of the code to work on to the static webpage for some reason, despite all the settings being the same on p5js. So, I first had to think of a simple idea I wanted to do for this experiment. So, I looked around the internet to see examples of text being rotating and found examples from the
					<a href=https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/texture target="_blank"> documentation page form p5js here </a>
					and found an example where the
					<a href=https://editor.p5js.org/slow_izzm/sketches/ByOUeWVjX target="_blank"> text was rotating to the mouse position. </a>
					However, none of these examples worked with my idea of multiple text rotating. So, for the first time, I relied on ChatGPT to give me an example of the multiple images rotating in a 3D Plane. The code that I was given from ChatGPT will put 4 texts on the screen, and rotate in on the X and Y Axis every single frame. It also has an orbitControl() function, which allows players to rotate and move the camera with a mouse.

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>Now, I wanted to give the users the ability to change the text that was already printed. To do this, I created an input box where players can put some kind of word or sentence into the input box. When the user then hits the button to change a text, it'll change the most left text first. After they make their first word change, if they choose to change a second word, it'll change the word to the right of the word that got changed, and it'll keep changing till it reaches the end, which then it'll loop back to the start and change the most left word again.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>To innovate it, I wanted to give an option for users to add an option to add to the words that are already on to the screen, rather than changing that are already on the lists. So, I created a 2nd input box where players can type a word that they want to add. When they click on the "Add" button, it would append to the list that contains the words that are rotating on the campus, which would draw out the text that they just added and start rotating. If the word is out of the screen, users can use the mouse to position the camera in a way that they can see all the rotating words, whether by scrolling the scroll wheel to zoom out the camera or holding right click to move the camera.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<p> I worked alone on this project so I contributed everything for this project.
						This experiment I feel was a mixed bag. I was busy this week so I wasn't able to give much time for this experiment and couldn't do a little bit more complicated rotation stuff that I had envisioned. However, I think I still had an enjoyable time when I was able to get this experiment up and running after doing a lot of research and experimenting on how to not only get a text to rotate in a 3d plane, but also with multiple different texts on the screen.
						<br><br>
						The lows for this experiment was getting Text to work how I wanted it to. Text was surprisingly really hard to get work, and there were very few tutorials or examples of the idea that I wanted to do. And for some reason, the examples that worked on p5js didn't work when I translated to my static webpage, so I had to come up with something that doesn't rely on importing libraries.
						The highs from this experiment, I learned a lot from this experiment, especially learning different methods of rotating or translating texts onto a 3D plane.
