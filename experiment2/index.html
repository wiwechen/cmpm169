			<h1>Experiment 2 - Vector Art, Animation & Interactivity</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>I'm taking this p5js drawing as the base of my experiment: <a href=http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_2_1_2_01 target="_blank"> http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_2_1_2_01 </a><br>
				I want to use their idea of changing the circle size and position, but I want to use a different shape like a square, and add more elements to randomness, like if the shape had a different color.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>After imitating the code but changing so it's shape and color, I wanted to expand on the color aspect of the square. What if when players clicked on the mouse key, 
				the colors of the square would change to a random color. In fact, what if every single square was a different random color. It's here where I used the color functions
				that p5js had to create these randomized color squares, and by clicking on the "C" key, it can swap between all squares in one randomized color or all squares will have a randomized color.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>The original code allowed users to use the mouse to control the position and the size of the circle. From there, I changed it to be square then circle, and added code that would 
					change the square's color to all a random color or each square is its own random color. Now, in order to innovate this, I wanted two things added. 1, to allow users to be in a 
					mode where they could rotate the squares and 2, the colors will always be random whenever you start up the page, no matter what.
 
					<br> <br>
					For the rotate, I had it set so when users would click the "r" key, it would go to the rotate state, where all the squares would rotate by pi/x angle, x being 3.0. In this rotate state, 
					users can increase the x value of pi/x by 0.2 to increase the rotation by click the "e" key, while also choosing the option to decrease the x value of pi/x by the same amount by clicking 
					the "q" key while x is greater than or equal to 3. From testing this, users can create unique art by rotating the squares while also changing its position and size with the movement of 
					the mouse. To change back from rotate mode, users can click on the "r" key again
					<br><br>
					
					After finishing this, I went to create a true randomized seed, where no matter when you refresh it, the colors will never start the same as before. In the original code of what I 
					imitated, the seed always started at 0, and then it would "randomly" pick a number when the mouse is clicked to get the next seed number. But that's is not truly randomized, since the 
					seed always started at 0 when refreshed, so the first "random" number or color in this case would always be the same, and continue on. So, in order to get a true unique number, I used 
					p5js's time functions that were available to me. I first got the values of the current month, current day, current year, current hour, current minute, and current second. I then turn 
					these values into strings and concat them together, following this format: <u>Month+Day+Year+Hour+Minute+Second</u>. So if it was <u>01/20/2024 at 20:54:56</u>, the string that would 
					have been concatenated would've been <u>1202024205456</u>. Finally, after getting the concatenating this string, I parse it as a number and set the randomSeed using that number. Because time 
					can only progress forward(at least at how we know at the moment), this seed can never be used again as it'll never be 01/20/2024 at 20:54:56 again, meaning the seed will always start 
					of differently. So unless the user manually changes their computer date and time, this means theoretically(cause it is still random), the squares will never start off as the same color 
					as the last refreshed page starting color.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>
				</ul>
				<p>For this assignment, I was working alone on this, so I was the only one contributing on this experiment. I think this was a good starting assignment for me to learn the ins 
					and outs of p5js for future projects. The highs of this project was definitely learning new things and thinking about how to innovate the original imitation code that I used for 
					the project. Lows though, I think it would be that there are some things that I don't understand with p5js, but I think I'll be able to figure all that out throughout this course.</p>
