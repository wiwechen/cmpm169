			<h1>Experiment 7 - Data Visualization & Networks</h1>

				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>
					I first needed to find an example of creating a pie chart on p5js. After some looking around, I found this pie chart example 
					that p5js had on their website's <a href=https://p5js.org/examples/form-pie-chart.html target="_blank"> example page</a>, 
					showcasing how to create a pie chart using the arc function.

				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>
					Next I had to integrate the data of Itadori's fight results he had during Season 1 and 2 of the anime. I accomplished 
					this by first creating an array with a size of 3, with each index having the amount of wins, loses, and no results of 
					Itadori's fight. Then, I used the map functions and map each number in the array from (0,12) to (0,360), which allowed us 
					to turn each number to a radian and use it to create the arcs needed to create a pie chart. The colors were kind of dark on 
					each of the arcs, so I changed the colors of each of the arcs when they were created.

				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>
					To Innovate this, I displayed the fights that Itadori one onto the left of the screen. I created an array of a size of 3, and 
					made it so each index either carried the fights that Itadori won, lost, or had no result by the end of the match. When the 
					drawing starts, it'll start displaying the fights that he won, but when users click shift, they'll be able to shift the data 
					to fights that Itadori lost, then to fights that he got no results, then looping back to fights that he won.
					<br><br>
					The next part might have been a bit mean spirited on my part, I then wanted to create a small pie graph of the fights that 
					he won, lost, or got no results; which of them were achieved by himself and which one was achieved with a teammate with him. 
					After creating 3 arrays of size 2 storing each solo/team ratio, I created a smaller pie chart and put it right under the texts 
					of fights that he either won, lost, or got no results. When the Shift key is pressed, the pie chart would also change with the 
					text and have the right pie chart data on whatever information is being displayed. And to differentiate between what the 2 
					colors were on the small pie chart, I added text at the bottom with their respective color showcasing which fights were solo 
					fights and which fights were fights that Itadori had a teammate with. While creating this text, I also figured out to display 
					the percentages of team/solo fights, so I displayed the percentages of those fights with the text, and then added to the 
					Win/Lost/No Result data text to show the percentage that he got during the anime's runtime.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<p>
					I worked alone on this project so I contributed everything for this project.
					I had a lot of fun creating this silly pie chart of fights that a main character had during the show's airtime. 
					It was also kind of mind opening on how many fights this guy lost when he fought by himself and how many fights 
					he won with a teammate(Don't worry, it gets better in the manga, kinda not really).
					<br>
					For the lows, there was one thing I really wanted to have which was displaying the text when 
					the cursor hovered over a certain part of the graph, instead of pressing Shift. However, I wasn't able to 
					find a way to do that with p5js running into a multitude of bugs so stuff with just pressing Shift to shift 
					through the Win/Lost/No Result fights that Itadori had.
					For the highs though, like I said in my reflection, it was really fun creating this experiment especially since 
					the data I chose was kinda silly but I still wanted to represent it with data visualization. Which also led me to 
					learn how to create a pie chart on p5js.
