			<h1>Experiment 3 - Generative Methods</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				
				<p>The concept of Generative method still really confuses me, so the experiment I want to try will be a bit more of a smaller experiment compared to the previous one. 
					To start off, I took the<a href=https://editor.p5js.org/wmodes/sketches/wGceMis-4 target="_blank"> random Walk code </a>that was shown in class and wanted to mess around and 
					see what I can change. What does changing the random values of x and y will do, how to change color, things that would affect the final drawing. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				
				<p>I first wanted to do more with the colors of the drawing. The drawing will always be drawing a line to a randomly placed point, what if each time it does, it can change its color? 
					I created a list of colors (blue, red, and purple) that would change, and each time a line is finished drawing, the random function will pick a random color in the list to change the 
					stroke color for the line. Next, I wanted to control the size of the lines while the lines were being drawn. I accomplished this by allowing the user to press the Q and E keys to control 
					how long the bounds of the lines should be, with Q decreasing the size of the bounds and E increasing the bounds. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				
				<p>I innovated the experiment by allowing the user to have more interactivity to the drawing. Building upon the idea of allowing the user to freely change the line size, I gave an option to 
					toggle between the option to either control or randomly change the stroke after a line is drawn. There's a 50% chance for the line to stay the same, 25% chance to increase the 
					lines's length and then 25% chance to decrease the line's length. 
					<br>
					I then added a randomized color scheme changer. Before, I had it set so that each time a line was finished drawing, the color of the lines would change its color within 1 color scheme, 
					which contained: red, blue, and purple. Now, I want to implement a new color scheme, which contains yellow, orange, and green; and have it so with a low percentage that it will change its 
					color scheme. I accomplished this by first creating a boolean variable called "colorScheme2" and setting it to false. If the boolean is equal to "False", the program will use "lineColor1" 
					to draw the lines, else it'll use "lineColor2" to draw the lines. I then created a list with an index of 50, and filled 49 of those with 0s and set the last index to 1. Using this index, 
					I put it in the random function to pick a number in the list and set it to a temp variable. If the temp variable is equal to 0, then the "colorScheme2" variable will not change, but if it's 
					equal to 1 then "colorScheme2" will be changed to the not of "colorScheme2", therefore changing it from true to false and vice versa. With a 1/50 chance of changing a color, the color scheme 
					will change so depending what color scheme it currently is, it'll only use the 3 colors of the current color scheme.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<p>
					I worked on this experiment alone, so I contributed to all the work for this experiment. 
					With my current knowledge of Generative Methods, I feel that there definitely can still be improvement in that area, and with more time and understanding I feel 
					like I would be able to expand more upon this experiment.
					<br>
					Some lows for this assingment; I'm still a little bit confused on some terms for Generative Method, and I think if I understood more functions for Generative Methods, 
					I think I would've been able to give out a better experiment for this assignment. For the highs, Despite the lows I just listed, I still had some fun messing around with this 
					experiment. Using the random walk code the Wes provided, I wanted to get deeper into and try to change and innovate for this experiment, which came with the color scheme changer 
					and the bound changer for the lines.
