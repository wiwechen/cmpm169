			<h1>Experiment 4 - Images, Video, & Sound Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				
				<p>
					For this experiment, I didn't really have an art/code to base off to "imitate". I just had an idea where "wouldn't it be funny 
					to have a chase scene with spongebob music playing in the background with squidward walking noise sfx". While I didn't have 
					an "art" I wanted to imitate, I did need to find some starting points that I can start with. I googled "how to move images 
					in p5js" and found <a href=https://editor.p5js.org/Pterodactyl_/sketches/SOu6kuuab target="_blank"> an example </a>
					that moved images according to the mouse's position. Using that examples, I imitated that so I can load an image onto p5.js 
					and be able to move it with my mouse.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>
					To integrate this imitated code with my idea, I need to integrate the sounds that would play when the player moves its mouse. 
					After adding a background image so it's not bland, I added a line of code at the Setup() function that would loop the 
					"Grass Skirt Chase" track from spongebob. Then, in the mousePressed() function, a sound effect that soundlike like Squidward's 
					footsteps would be played. Originally, I wanted the steps to be played when the mouse is moving, as then the footsteps would 
					play when you are moving. However, due to the nature of the mouseMoved() function, it would've played that sfx every single 
					frame, which created a terrible sound that played whenever the mouse was moved. I still wanted that Sfx to play in this piece, 
					so unfortunately I had to compromise to it playing when the mouse was pressed.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				
				
				<p>
					Next, I had to figure out what would be "following" the slime around. While trying to figure out what should chase the slime, 
					I was also researching how to display sound waves, as that was something I wanted to do. It was then I found the
					<a href=https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Amplitude target="_blank"> p5.Amplitude page</a>, which showed how to use Amplitude with 
					an ellipse. Using this page as an example, I implemented this ellipse into the drawing, and it would change its size depending on 
					the sound(s) that is playing and would follow the slime around as the ellipse position is set to the same as the mouse. I still 
					wanted to do a bit more with the ellipse as the color of it was pretty bland. So I added some code that would change its color 
					each time the mouse was pressed.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<p>
					I worked alone on this project so I contributed everything for this project.
					This was a fun project to go through. I felt more confident doing this assignment compared to the previous one, as messing 
					around with images and sound is much easier to me than doing Generative Methods. 
					<br><br>
					Some lows for this assingment; a power outage happened over at my place on Sunday(and it's still out during the time of writing 
					this), so I lost a day of being able to work on this. If that didn't happen, this would have more elements to it besides 
					what is currently on here.
					
					For the highs, I still had fun messing with images and load/playing sounds when messing around with this experiment, and was able
					to get a lot from doing this experiment for this class.
