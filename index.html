					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>It's me, William Chen. I use he/him pronouns, and I'm currently a 4th year CS:GD student. Big fan of games, anime, manga, <br>
					 and Tokusatsu(specifically Kamen Rider and Ultraman). My favorite game series are Kingdom Hearts, the Persona series, Final Fantasy<br>
					 and the Devil May Cry series. Currently however, I am way too deep into Genshin Impact and Honkai Star Rail.
