			<h1>Experiment 5 - 3D Graphics</h1>

				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				
				
				<p>While going through<a href=https://openprocessing.org/sketch/794227 target="_blank"> the tutorial </a> on 3D graphics that was given in the 	
					lecture slides, I found this rotating cube that just rotated on the Y-Axis on the 4th page of the tutorial. I wanted to do a project 
					with a cube being the main star for this 3D Object experiment, so I took and imitated that code to start off for this experiment.
				</p> 
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>
					To add onto what I've imitated, I wanted to also rotate the cube on the X-axis at the same time as the box is rotating on the 
					Y-axis. So I gave it a line of code that would rotate the box on the X-axis. Next, I needed to figure out how to give the box 
					color. I created a variable that has the color red, and before drawing the box I filled its color with the variable. During this 
					time, I found out here that if you put in the noStroke function, that black lines on each of the edges would not be drawn and it 
					would be a pure red cube. But because it didn't look appealing to see when the box was rotating, I left the stroke on the cube so 
					it'll be easier to see the cube rotating.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>
					To innovate this experiment, I wanted for the box to change through user interactions. Firstly, I wanted the box's color, its rotation speed, 
					and its size when the mouse was pressed by the user. To do this, I first created a function that would change the variable function color to a 
					random color when called, and put that function in the mousePressed() function so it'll be called when the mouse is clicked.
					<br><br>
					Next, I created a function called changeSpeed(), which would change a rotateXSpeed and rotateYSpeed variable to be a random number from 0 to 0.2. 
					Since the original code had "framecount * 0.01" to control its rotation speed, I changed 0.01 respectively to either rotateXSpeed and 
					RotateYSpeed for the rotateY and rotateX function in draw. Like last time, I then put this function in the mousePressed() function so it'll 
					trigger when the mouse is pressed. After that, I created a variable called boxSize and it would randomly be a different number between 30 and 
					100 when the mouse is pressed. Using that variable, I put that in the box() function in draw() making it so the size of the cube will be 
					different each time the mouse is clicked.
					<br><br>
					I still wanted to do more with mouse click, so I decided to make the box randomly rotate either forward or backward on each axis when the 
					mouse is pressed. So in the changeSpeed() function, after each of the speeds for each of the axis was determined, I created an if statement 
					for random() to pick either 1 or 0. If random() picked 1, then I would multiply the rotateXSpeed variable that was just determined by -1, 
					making it rotate the other way around than what it was supposed to do. I also did the same again for rotateYSpeed, so this way we can either 
					have both variables rotate forward on their axis, both variables rotate backward on their axis, or only one of them rotate backward on their 
					axis while the other rotates forwards on their axis.
					<br><br>
					To finish it off, I created keys that would do one of the changes that would've been done if the mouse was pressed, allowing users to see 
					and create the right cube they want to see spinning. If 'q' was pressed, then it would change the direction of the rotation of the X-axis to 
					be the opposite of what it currently is, and pressing 'e' will do the same but for the Y-axis. Pressing 'w' will change the rotating speed on 
					the X-axis to be a random number from 0 to 0.2, and the same will be applied to the Y-axis when 's' is pressed on the keyboard. Pressing 'c' 
					will change the box's color to be a random color and pressing the spacebar will change the box's size to be a random size.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<p>
					I did this project by myself, so I contributed to all the parts of the project. This was a really fun experiment with messing around the 
					cubes, and figuring out what was the right speed for a rotating cube, because a really fast rotating cube can hardly be seen, especially when 
					it's rotating on two different axis.
					<br><br>
					The lows of this experiment was that due to time, I wasn't able to add more to this experiment. I think one thing I wanted to do but I couldn't 
					implement in time was figure out to have some kind of hand in the background that makes it seem like the hand levitating the rotating cube. 
					The highs for this experiment was I had fun with this experiment, and I learned how 3D objects function in p5js and in general how they work 
					with code.
